# Feature Specification: Amazon URL Normalizer

**Feature Branch**: `009-amazon-url-url`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "入力されたAmazonのURLを正規化（短いURL）に修正するツールを実装してください。デザインは他ツールと合わせてください。他ツールと合わせてko-fiのボタンも実装してください。.githubワークフローの更新とAWS CDKの更新も忘れずに行ってください。実装後はchrome MCPで動作確認をお願いします"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Tool to normalize Amazon URLs to shorter format
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Users who share Amazon product links
   → Actions: Input Amazon URL, normalize to shortest valid format, copy result
   → Data: Amazon product URLs with various tracking parameters
   → Constraints: Must maintain product ID, remove unnecessary parameters
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects are clear from description and existing tool patterns
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Input URL → Normalize → Display/Copy short URL
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → URL parsing, normalization, validation, display, copy function
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Amazon URL with product ID (ASIN)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No implementation details in requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users frequently share Amazon product URLs that contain tracking parameters, session IDs, and other unnecessary query strings, making the URLs unnecessarily long and cluttered. Users need a simple tool to convert these long URLs into clean, short URLs that contain only the essential product identifier, making them easier to share via email, chat, or social media while preserving the product link functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a long Amazon product URL (e.g., https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0ABCDEF/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=example&qid=1234567890&sr=8-1), **When** they paste it into the input field and click normalize, **Then** the system displays the shortest valid URL (https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0ABCDEF)

2. **Given** a user has normalized an Amazon URL, **When** they click the copy button, **Then** the short URL is copied to their clipboard and a success message is displayed

3. **Given** a user has an Amazon URL that is already in short format, **When** they paste it into the input field and click normalize, **Then** the system confirms the URL is already normalized

4. **Given** a user pastes a non-Amazon URL, **When** they attempt to normalize it, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the URL is not a valid Amazon URL

5. **Given** a user pastes an Amazon search results URL (without a product ID), **When** they attempt to normalize it, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the URL does not contain a valid product identifier

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the URL contains a valid ASIN but is from an unsupported Amazon domain?
  → System should normalize the URL while preserving the domain
- What happens when the URL format is malformed or incomplete?
  → System should display a clear error message explaining the issue
- What happens when the user clears the input field?
  → System should reset to the initial state with no output displayed

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept Amazon product URLs from any Amazon domain (amazon.com, amazon.co.jp, amazon.co.uk, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) from the input URL
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove all unnecessary query parameters, tracking codes, and path segments from the URL
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate the shortest valid Amazon product URL format (https://[domain]/dp/[ASIN])
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that the input URL is a valid Amazon product URL before attempting normalization
- **FR-006**: System MUST display clear error messages when invalid URLs are provided
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a one-click copy function to copy the normalized URL to the clipboard
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback when the URL is successfully copied
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain consistent visual design with existing developer tools in the suite
- **FR-010**: System MUST include a Ko-fi support button matching the style of other tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST support dark mode consistent with other tools in the suite
- **FR-012**: System MUST be responsive and work on mobile devices
- **FR-013**: System MUST clearly indicate when a URL is already in normalized format
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve the original Amazon domain (not convert between regional domains)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Amazon Product URL**: Consists of domain (regional Amazon site), path segments, ASIN (unique product identifier), and optional query parameters (tracking, search context, session data)
- **Normalized URL**: Minimal Amazon product URL containing only domain, "/dp/" path, and ASIN
