# Feature Specification: Support Me Button Visibility Reversal

**Feature Branch**: `004-support-me`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Support Me„Éú„Çø„É≥„ÇíÈÄöÂ∏∏ÊôÇ„ÅØË°®Á§∫„Åó„Å¶„Åä„Åç„ÄÅ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏„ÅÆ‰∏ãÈÉ®„Å´„Çπ„ÇØ„É≠„Éº„É´„Åó„Åü„ÇâÊ∂à„Åà„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What should be the exact scroll threshold for hiding the Support Me button? ‚Üí A: 70% down the page (same as previous implementation)
- Q: What should be the button positioning for the Support Me button? ‚Üí A: Bottom-left corner (same as existing implementation)
- Q: What should be the animation duration for the fade effect? ‚Üí A: 300ms (same as current implementation)
- Q: How should the button behave when the page content is shorter than the viewport height? ‚Üí A: Always visible (since user can't scroll to trigger hiding)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want the Support Me button to be visible by default when I first visit the page, but hide automatically when I scroll to the bottom of the page, so that it doesn't obstruct content when I'm likely finished reading and ready to take action or navigate away.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the page for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** the Support Me button is visible
2. **Given** the Support Me button is visible, **When** the user scrolls to 70% of the page height, **Then** the Support Me button fades out smoothly
3. **Given** the Support Me button is hidden after scrolling down, **When** the user scrolls back up above the threshold, **Then** the Support Me button fades in again
4. **Given** the Support Me button is visible, **When** the user clicks on it, **Then** it opens the Ko-fi support page/modal as configured

### Edge Cases
- When page content is shorter than viewport height, button remains always visible
- How does the button behave on mobile devices with different scroll behaviors?
- What happens if the user rapidly scrolls up and down across the threshold?
- How does the button interact with other floating UI elements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the Support Me button immediately when the page loads
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when user has scrolled to 70% of the page height
- **FR-003**: System MUST fade out the Support Me button with a smooth animation when reaching the scroll threshold
- **FR-004**: System MUST fade in the Support Me button when user scrolls back above the threshold
- **FR-005**: Button MUST maintain its original Ko-fi functionality (opening support page/modal) when clicked
- **FR-006**: Button MUST be positioned consistently at bottom-left corner (20px from bottom, 20px from left)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle window resize events and recalculate scroll thresholds accordingly
- **FR-008**: Fade behavior MUST work consistently across modern browsers (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge)
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect user's preference for reduced motion if applicable
- **FR-010**: Button MUST remain accessible to screen readers with appropriate ARIA attributes
- **FR-011**: When page content height is less than viewport height, button MUST remain always visible (since user cannot scroll to trigger hiding)
- **FR-012**: Animation duration MUST be 300ms for consistent user experience
