# Research: Ko-fi Widget Integration

## Widget Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Use Ko-fi's official overlay widget script with floating chat configuration
**Rationale**: Official widget ensures proper styling, functionality, and maintenance by Ko-fi
**Alternatives considered**: Custom donation button - rejected due to Ko-fi ecosystem integration requirements

## Integration Approach

**Decision**: Implement via Nuxt 3 composable for consistent integration across all tools
**Rationale**: Composables provide reactive functionality and can be easily imported into each tool
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct script inclusion per tool - rejected due to code duplication
- Global plugin - rejected due to independent tool architecture requirement

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Silent failure with complete widget hiding when Ko-fi service unavailable
**Rationale**: Aligns with clarification requirements, prevents UI disruption
**Alternatives considered**: Disabled state display - rejected per user clarification

## Cross-Tool Consistency

**Decision**: Shared configuration object and consistent positioning across all 22 applications
**Rationale**: Maintains user experience consistency and simplifies maintenance
**Alternatives considered**: Per-tool customization - rejected for simplicity

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Lazy loading with async script injection to minimize impact on page load
**Rationale**: External script should not block critical rendering path
**Alternatives considered**: Synchronous loading - rejected due to performance constraints

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Playwright E2E tests to verify widget presence and functionality
**Rationale**: Widget is visual/interactive component best tested in browser environment
**Alternatives considered**: Unit tests - insufficient for external script integration testing
