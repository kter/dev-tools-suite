# Feature Specification: Ko-fi Tip Widget Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-ko-fi-com`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ko-fi.com„ÅÆTip Widget„ÇíËøΩÂä†„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ„Ç¶„Ç£„Ç∏„Çß„ÉÉ„Éà„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„ÅØÊ¨°„ÅÆÈÄö„Çä„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ   <script src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/scripts/overlay-widget.js'></script>
<script>
  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('kterr', {
    'type': 'floating-chat',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': 'Support me',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.background-color': '#00b9fe',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fff'
  });
</script>"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: Should the Ko-fi tip widget be displayed in all environments or only in production? ‚Üí A: All environments (dev, staging, production)
- Q: Where should the Ko-fi widget be displayed? ‚Üí A: All 21 tool pages AND the landing page
- Q: When the Ko-fi service is unavailable or blocked, how should the widget behave? ‚Üí A: Hide completely (no trace)
- Q: How should the widget adapt for mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Same as desktop (floating position)
- Q: Should the widget maintain the exact same position on all pages? ‚Üí A: Fixed position on all pages

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to the Dev Tools Suite, I want to see a donation/tip widget so that I can support the project financially if I find the tools useful. The widget should be unobtrusive but easily accessible when users want to contribute.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on any tool page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a floating tip button appears on the screen
2. **Given** the tip widget is visible, **When** the user clicks on it, **Then** the Ko-fi donation overlay opens
3. **Given** a user is on the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the same tip widget appears consistently
4. **Given** the widget is displayed, **When** the user continues using tools, **Then** the widget does not interfere with tool functionality

### Edge Cases
- When Ko-fi service is unavailable, the widget will hide completely without any visual trace
- When users have ad blockers that block third-party scripts, the widget will not appear (same as service unavailable)
- On mobile devices, the widget maintains the same floating position and behavior as desktop (no responsive adjustments)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a Ko-fi tip widget on all tool pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the widget on the landing page
- **FR-003**: Widget MUST be visible but not obstruct main content or tool functionality
- **FR-004**: Widget MUST display with "Support me" text on the button
- **FR-005**: Widget MUST use a blue (#00b9fe) background color for consistency
- **FR-006**: Widget MUST link to the Ko-fi account identified as 'kterr'
- **FR-007**: Widget MUST appear on all 21 tool pages and the landing page (22 pages total)
- **FR-008**: Widget MUST maintain the exact same fixed position across all 22 pages (no per-page adjustments)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle widget loading failures by hiding the widget completely (no error messages or disabled states)
- **FR-010**: Widget MUST appear consistently across all environments (development, staging, and production)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Ko-fi Widget Configuration**: Represents the widget settings including account ID, button text, colors, and positioning
- **Page Integration Points**: Represents where the widget will be embedded across different tool pages
