**Feature Branch**: `001-gcp`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "GCPÈñ¢ÈÄ£„ÅÆÂØæÂøú„ÇíÂÖ®„Å¶ÂâäÈô§„Åó„Å¶"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Remove all Google Cloud Platform integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, CI/CD system
   ‚Üí Actions: Remove, cleanup, simplify
   ‚Üí Data: Infrastructure code, deployment configs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Maintain AWS deployment functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear from existing codebase analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Developer deploys without GCP complexity
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on removal and cleanup
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Infrastructure components, deployment pipelines
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, scope is well-defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be removed and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement removal (specific commands, file operations)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders and project maintainers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the dev-tools-suite project, I want all Google Cloud Platform integration removed so that the codebase is simpler, maintenance burden is reduced, and deployment only targets AWS infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to deploy the application, **When** they run deployment commands, **Then** only AWS infrastructure is provisioned and used
2. **Given** a developer examines the codebase, **When** they look for cloud provider references, **Then** they only find AWS-related code and configurations
3. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs, **When** deployment occurs, **Then** only AWS services are targeted without any GCP operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing GCP resources need cleanup before removal?
- How does the system ensure no broken references remain after GCP code removal?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all Google Cloud Platform infrastructure code from the codebase
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all Firebase Hosting configurations and deployments
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove all Terraform infrastructure code related to GCP
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove GCP-related environment variables and configurations
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove GCP deployment workflows from CI/CD pipelines
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove GCP-related documentation and references
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all AWS infrastructure and deployment functionality
- **FR-008**: System MUST update navigation and cross-platform links to remove GCP references
- **FR-009**: System MUST remove GCP-specific domain configurations from DNS routing
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain working deployment to AWS environments (dev and production)

### Key Entities
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: GCP-specific Terraform modules and configurations in infrastructure/terraform/
- **Firebase Configuration**: Firebase project settings, hosting configurations, and deployment files
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow files containing GCP deployment steps and matrix configurations
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md and other files containing GCP setup instructions and architecture details
- **DNS Configuration**: Route53 records and CDK code managing GCP custom domains
- **Navigation Components**: Landing page components with cross-platform navigation links
