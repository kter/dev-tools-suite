# Feature Specification: GitHub-style Tool Search with Keyboard Shortcut

**Feature Branch**: `002-github-serena-mcp`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ツール数が増えてきたので、ツールの絞り込みを行えるようにしたいです。GitHubの検索のように、/キーを押すと入力欄がホバーし、ツール名を入力するとリアルタイムで絞り込みが行われるようにしたいです。調査・実装はサブエージェントでSerena MCPを使用し、動作確認にはPlaywright MCPを使用してください"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified need for GitHub-style search functionality for tool filtering
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Landing page users browsing tools
   → Actions: Press '/' key, type search query, filter results
   → Data: Tool names, tool cards/listings
   → Constraints: Real-time filtering, keyboard accessibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should search include tool descriptions or only names?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should search results be highlighted/bolded?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens when no results match?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: press '/', search input appears, type query, see filtered results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Tool listings, search input interface, keyboard events
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Some clarifications needed but core functionality is clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What should be included in the search functionality? → A: Search both tool names and descriptions
- Q: What should be displayed when a search query matches no tools? → A: Show empty space with no message
- Q: Should matching search terms be visually highlighted in the filtered results? → A: No highlighting - just show/hide tools
- Q: How should the search input field be positioned and styled when it appears? → A: Fixed overlay at top center of page
- Q: What should happen when the user presses the '/' key while the search input is already visible and focused? → A: Insert '/' character into search input

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user visiting the dev tools landing page with many available tools, I want to quickly find specific tools by typing their names, so that I can efficiently locate and access the tool I need without scrolling through a long list.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the landing page with multiple tools displayed, **When** I press the '/' key, **Then** a search input field should appear and be focused for immediate typing
2. **Given** the search input is active and focused, **When** I type "password", **Then** only tools containing "password" in their name should remain visible in real-time
3. **Given** I have typed a search query that matches some tools, **When** I clear the search input or press Escape, **Then** all tools should be displayed again
4. **Given** I am typing in the search input, **When** I type a query that matches no tools, **Then** an empty space should be displayed with no tools visible
5. **Given** the search input is visible, **When** I click outside the search area or press Escape, **Then** the search input should be hidden and all tools displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user types special characters or symbols in search?
- How does system handle very long search queries?
- Should search work when user is focused on other page elements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a search input field as a fixed overlay at the top center of the page when user presses the '/' key from anywhere on the landing page
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically focus the search input when it appears for immediate typing
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter visible tools in real-time as user types search queries
- **FR-004**: System MUST match search queries against both tool names and descriptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST perform case-insensitive search matching
- **FR-006**: System MUST hide the search input and show all tools when user presses Escape key
- **FR-007**: System MUST hide the search input and show all tools when user clicks outside the search area
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow the '/' character to be inserted normally into the search input when the search field is already focused
- **FR-009**: System MUST show all tools again when search input is cleared
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle empty search queries by displaying all tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST display empty space with no tools visible when search query matches no tools
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain original tool layout and styling during filtering operations without highlighting search terms

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tool Listing**: Individual tool cards/items that can be shown or hidden based on search criteria
- **Search Interface**: Input field with focus management and keyboard event handling
- **Search Query**: User-entered text used for filtering tool listings
- **Tool Metadata**: Name and potentially description used for search matching
