## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When should the Ko-fi button fade in as the user scrolls down the page? ‚Üí A: When 70% of page height is scrolled
- Q: Where should the Ko-fi Support Me button be positioned on the screen? ‚Üí A: Bottom-left corner
- Q: How long should the fade in/out animation take? ‚Üí A: 300ms (quick, subtle)
- Q: What should happen when page content is shorter than viewport height? ‚Üí A: Always show button (no scroll possible)
- Q: Which browsers should the feature support? ‚Üí A: Modern browsers only (last 2 versions)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want the Ko-fi.com Support Me button to appear only when I've scrolled near the bottom of the page, so that it doesn't interfere with my reading experience while still being available when I'm likely to be engaged with the content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing a page with Ko-fi Support button integration, **When** they first load the page, **Then** the float button is not visible
2. **Given** a user is scrolling through a page, **When** they reach 70% of the page height, **Then** the Ko-fi Support button fades in smoothly
3. **Given** the Ko-fi Support button is visible after scrolling down, **When** the user scrolls back up above the threshold, **Then** the button fades out smoothly
4. **Given** the Ko-fi Support button is visible, **When** the user clicks on it, **Then** it opens the Ko-fi support page/modal as configured

### Edge Cases
- When the page content is shorter than the viewport height, the button is always visible (no scroll threshold applies)
- How does the button behave on mobile devices with different scroll behaviors?
- What happens if Ko-fi.com service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the button interact with other floating UI elements (chat widgets, scroll-to-top buttons)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST hide the Ko-fi Support Me float button when the page initially loads
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when user has scrolled to 70% of the page height
- **FR-003**: System MUST fade in the Ko-fi Support Me button with a smooth animation lasting 300ms
- **FR-004**: System MUST fade out the Ko-fi Support Me button when user scrolls above the threshold
- **FR-005**: Button MUST maintain its original Ko-fi.com functionality (opening support page/modal) when clicked
- **FR-006**: Button MUST be positioned at the bottom-left corner of the viewport
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle window resize events and recalculate scroll thresholds accordingly
- **FR-008**: Fade behavior MUST work consistently across modern browsers (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge)
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect user's preference for reduced motion if applicable
- **FR-010**: Button MUST remain accessible to screen readers even when visually hidden
- **FR-011**: When page content height is less than viewport height, button MUST be visible immediately without scroll threshold requirement
