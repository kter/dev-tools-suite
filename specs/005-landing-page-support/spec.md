# Feature Specification: Landing Page Support Button Scroll Behavior

**Feature Branch**: `005-landing-page-support`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "landing-page„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´Support Me„Éï„É≠„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞„Éú„Çø„É≥„Çí„Éö„Éº„Ç∏‰∏ãÈÉ®70ÔºÖ„Åæ„Åß„Çπ„ÇØ„É≠„Éº„É´„Åó„Åü„ÇâÊ∂à„Åà„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor viewing the landing page, I want the Support Me floating button to be visible initially and then disappear when I scroll to 70% of the page height, so that the button doesn't obstruct my view of content near the end of the page while still being readily available for support when I first arrive.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit the landing page, **When** the page loads completely, **Then** the Support Me floating button should be visible and accessible
2. **Given** the Support Me button is visible, **When** I scroll down to 70% of the page height, **Then** the button should fade out smoothly
3. **Given** I have scrolled past 70% and the button is hidden, **When** I scroll back up above the 70% threshold, **Then** the button should fade back in
4. **Given** the page content is shorter than the viewport, **When** I view the page, **Then** the button should remain visible at all times

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the page content is very short (less than viewport height)?
- How does the system handle rapid scrolling back and forth around the 70% threshold?
- What happens when users have reduced motion preferences enabled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

**Note**: This specification appears to duplicate functionality already implemented in feature 004-support-me. The current landing page already has a Ko-fi Support Me button with the exact behavior described in this request. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this intended for a different page, different button, or different implementation than the existing Ko-fi button?]

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Landing page MUST display a Support Me floating button visible on initial page load
- **FR-002**: System MUST track user scroll position as a percentage of total page height
- **FR-003**: Button MUST fade out smoothly when user scrolls to 70% of page height
- **FR-004**: Button MUST fade back in when user scrolls above the 70% threshold
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain button visibility for pages shorter than viewport height
- **FR-006**: Button MUST use smooth CSS transitions for fade in/out effects
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect user's reduced motion preferences by disabling animations
- **FR-008**: Button MUST maintain accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, focus states) during state changes
- **FR-009**: Button MUST provide click functionality to open support mechanism [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Ko-fi integration, custom donation page, or other support method?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST throttle scroll events for performance optimization

### Key Entities
- **Support Button State**: Represents visibility and position state with attributes of scroll threshold, animation timing, accessibility properties
- **Scroll Position Tracker**: Tracks current scroll percentage and page dimensions for threshold calculations

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed

## Duplication Warning

**CRITICAL**: This feature specification appears to request functionality that was already implemented in feature 004-support-me. The current landing page (tools/landing-page) already includes a Ko-fi Support Me button with the exact behavior described:

- ‚úÖ Visible on page load
- ‚úÖ Fades out at 70% scroll
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions (300ms)
- ‚úÖ Accessibility compliance
- ‚úÖ Reduced motion support

**Recommendation**: Verify if this is:
1. A request for a different page/context
2. A different type of support button
3. An unintended duplicate of completed work
4. A modification to the existing implementation
