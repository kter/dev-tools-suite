- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users of any developer tool can access legal compliance information through a consistent footer that appears on all tool pages, providing easy access to terms of service and legal disclosures as required by Japanese commercial law.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on any tool page, **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** they see a footer with legal disclosure link
2. **Given** a user clicks the legal disclosure link, **When** the link is activated, **Then** they are redirected to https://www.tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure
3. **Given** a user visits multiple tools, **When** they check the footer, **Then** all footers have consistent appearance and content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the legal disclosure external link is unavailable?
- How does the footer appear on mobile devices with limited screen space?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a footer on every tool page that matches the landing page footer design
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a link to legal disclosure (特定商取引法に基づく表記) in the footer
- **FR-003**: Legal disclosure link MUST redirect to https://www.tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure
- **FR-004**: Footer MUST be consistent across all developer tools (hash-generator, qr-generator, password-generator, etc.)
- **FR-005**: Footer MUST be responsive and display properly on mobile and desktop devices
- **FR-006**: Footer MUST maintain visual consistency with the existing landing page footer

### Key Entities
- **Footer Component**: Reusable UI element containing navigation links and legal compliance information
- **Legal Disclosure Link**: External link directing users to compliance information required by Japanese commercial law
