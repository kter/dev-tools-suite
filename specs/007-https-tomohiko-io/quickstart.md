# Quickstart: Footer Implementation Verification

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides step-by-step verification that the footer implementation meets all requirements across all developer tools.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- Playwright test environment configured
- Access to both development and production environments

## Verification Steps

### 1. Clone and Setup (if needed)
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dev-tools-suite
npm install
```

### 2. Development Environment Testing

#### Start Local Development
```bash
# Test individual tool locally
cd tools/hash-generator
npm run dev
# Verify footer appears at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Visual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Footer appears at bottom of page
- [ ] Copyright text: "© 2025 DevTools. Built with Nuxt 3 and deployed on AWS."
- [ ] Legal disclosure link: "特定商取引法に基づく表記"
- [ ] Link opens https://www.tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure in new tab
- [ ] Footer styling matches design (gray text, center alignment)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works correctly with footer

### 3. Responsive Design Testing

#### Desktop (1024px+)
```bash
# Open browser dev tools, set viewport to 1200x800
# Verify footer displays correctly
```

#### Tablet (768px)
```bash
# Set viewport to 768x1024
# Verify footer text remains readable
# Check that layout doesn't break
```

#### Mobile (320px)
```bash
# Set viewport to 320x568
# Verify footer text wraps appropriately
# Ensure link remains clickable
```

### 4. Cross-Tool Verification

#### Test All Tools (Sample Commands)
```bash
# Hash Generator
cd tools/hash-generator && npm run dev

# QR Generator
cd tools/qr-generator && npm run dev

# Password Generator
cd tools/password-generator && npm run dev

# Continue for all 23+ tools...
```

#### Consistency Checklist
- [ ] All tools have identical footer content
- [ ] All tools use same CSS classes
- [ ] All tools maintain proper spacing (mt-20)
- [ ] Legal disclosure link works on all tools

### 5. E2E Test Execution

#### Run Playwright Tests
```bash
# From repository root
npx playwright test --grep="footer"

# Test specific tool
npx playwright test tests/hash-generator.spec.js
```

#### Expected Test Results
- [ ] All footer presence tests pass
- [ ] All legal disclosure link tests pass
- [ ] All responsive design tests pass
- [ ] All dark mode compatibility tests pass

### 6. Production Environment Verification

#### AWS Environment
```bash
# Dev environment
open https://hash-generator.dev.devtools.site
open https://qr-generator.dev.devtools.site
# Verify footer on each tool

# Production environment
open https://hash-generator.devtools.site
open https://qr-generator.devtools.site
# Verify footer on each tool
```

#### GCP Environment
```bash
# Dev environment
open https://hash-generator.gcp.dev.devtools.site
open https://qr-generator.gcp.dev.devtools.site

# Production environment
open https://hash-generator.gcp.devtools.site
open https://qr-generator.gcp.devtools.site
```

### 7. Legal Disclosure Link Verification

#### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to any tool
2. Scroll to footer
3. Click "特定商取引法に基づく表記" link
4. Verify:
   - [ ] Opens in new tab
   - [ ] URL is https://www.tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure
   - [ ] Page loads successfully
   - [ ] No browser security warnings

#### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run link validation test
npx playwright test --grep="legal-disclosure"
```

## Success Criteria

### All Tools Must Pass
- ✅ Footer displays correctly on all viewport sizes
- ✅ Legal disclosure link functions properly
- ✅ Dark/light mode compatibility maintained
- ✅ No layout breaking or content overflow
- ✅ Consistent styling across all tools

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Page load time not increased significantly
- ✅ Footer renders without layout shift
- ✅ No console errors related to footer

### Accessibility Requirements
- ✅ Footer text is screen reader accessible
- ✅ Legal disclosure link is keyboard navigable
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML structure maintained

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Footer Not Appearing
- Check that footer HTML was added to app.vue
- Verify closing div structure is correct
- Ensure no CSS conflicts with existing styles

#### Legal Link Not Working
- Verify exact URL: https://www.tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure
- Check target="_blank" and rel attributes
- Test in different browsers

#### Responsive Issues
- Check viewport meta tag in each tool
- Verify Tailwind CSS classes are applied correctly
- Test on actual mobile devices if needed

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Quick footer check across all tools
grep -r "特定商取引法に基づく表記" tools/*/app.vue

# Verify legal disclosure URL consistency
grep -r "tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure" tools/*/app.vue

# Check footer styling consistency
grep -r "mt-20 text-center text-gray-500" tools/*/app.vue
```
