## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What support mechanism should the button use across all tools? ‚Üí A: Same Ko-fi integration as landing page (kofiUsername prop required)
- Q: How should the support button component be distributed to all tools? ‚Üí A: Shared component in tools/shared/ directory (import from ../shared/)
- Q: What Ko-fi username should be used across all tools? ‚Üí A: same as landing-page 'kterr'
- Q: How should the component handle different tool page structures? ‚Üí A: Auto-detect scroll container (document.body vs main content area)
- Q: What testing strategy should cover all 23 tools? ‚Üí A: Individual E2E tests for every tool (23 separate test files)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of any developer tool in the suite (hash generator, QR generator, password generator, etc.), I want to see a Support Me floating button that is initially visible when I load the page and then disappears smoothly when I scroll to 70% of the page height, so that I can easily support the developer when I first arrive but the button doesn't obstruct my view of content near the end of the page.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit any tool page (hash-generator, qr-generator, password-generator, etc.), **When** the page loads completely, **Then** the Support Me floating button should be visible and accessible
2. **Given** the Support Me button is visible on any tool page, **When** I scroll down to 70% of the page height, **Then** the button should fade out smoothly with the same behavior as the landing page
3. **Given** I have scrolled past 70% and the button is hidden, **When** I scroll back up above the 70% threshold, **Then** the button should fade back in consistently across all tools
4. **Given** a tool page has content shorter than the viewport, **When** I view the page, **Then** the button should remain visible at all times
5. **Given** I click the Support Me button on any tool, **When** the click is processed, **Then** the Ko-fi support page should open in a new tab with the same integration as the landing page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tools have different content heights and scroll behaviors?
- How does the system handle tools with different layouts (single page vs multi-section)?
- What happens when users rapidly switch between different tools?
- How does the button behave on mobile devices with different viewport sizes across tools?

### Testing Requirements
- Individual E2E test files must be created for all 23 developer tools to ensure consistent button behavior
- Each test must verify: initial visibility, 70% scroll threshold, fade animations, Ko-fi integration, and accessibility compliance
- Tests must validate auto-detection of scroll containers works correctly for each tool's specific layout

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: All developer tools MUST display a Support Me floating button visible on initial page load
- **FR-002**: Each tool MUST implement identical scroll position tracking to the landing page (70% threshold)
- **FR-003**: Button MUST fade out smoothly when user scrolls to 70% of page height on any tool
- **FR-004**: Button MUST fade back in when user scrolls above the 70% threshold on any tool
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent button styling and positioning across all tools
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve button visibility for pages shorter than viewport height on all tools
- **FR-007**: Button MUST use identical smooth CSS transitions (300ms) across all tools for consistency
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect user's reduced motion preferences by disabling animations on all tools
- **FR-009**: Button MUST maintain consistent accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, focus states) across all tools
- **FR-010**: Button MUST provide identical Ko-fi integration across all tools using kofiUsername='kterr'
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement consistent scroll event throttling (100ms) across all tools for performance
- **FR-012**: Button MUST be positioned consistently (bottom-left, 20px margins) across all 23 developer tools
- **FR-013**: System MUST auto-detect appropriate scroll container (document.body vs main content area) to handle different tool layouts without breaking button functionality

### Key Entities
- **Universal Support Button Component**: Reusable component located in tools/shared/ directory with standardized scroll behavior, styling, and positioning for deployment across all tools via ../shared/ imports
- **Scroll Position Tracker**: Standardized scroll percentage calculation with auto-detection of scroll container and threshold detection for consistent behavior across different page heights and layouts
- **Tool Integration Interface**: Mechanism for each tool to incorporate the support button without modifying existing tool-specific functionality
